## üöÄ Getting Started

### Development

1. **Storefront (Next.js):**

   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   Access at: http://localhost:3000

2. **Admin Panel (React):**
   ```bash
   cd src/Web/AdminPanel
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   Access at: http://localhost:3001

### Production Build

1. **Storefront:**
   ```bash
   cd src/Web/Storefront
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

2. **Admin Panel:**
   ```bash
   cd src/Web/AdminPanel
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

### Docker Deployment

Both applications are configured for Docker deployment:

```bash
# Build and run all services
docker-compose up --build

# Storefront: http://localhost:3000
